    Game ideas:

* 2048
    * see old rust repo for ui design / todos
* word//e (credit sengmin for the idea)
  * some UI questions about this
    * how many "colors" will we need? Is normal, inverse, flashing enough?
        * maybe double low-res hand-drawn letters ?
    * we'll need a word bank for this I think... will it fit into RAM?
        Will lookups be fast enough??
        (trie data structure??)
* maze generator
    * double low-res would be a good fit
* ghosts (translate from BASIC)
* pumpkins (already have the sprites)
    * game of life
* game of life but with ghosts (multi-color!)
    * hi-res!

    Harder (save these for if/when rust is working):

* footsies
* chess
* go
* hi-res fractals
* tetris
* pokemon sokoban (can we do hi-res greyscale if we use a monochrome display?)
* snakes and ladders (credit Sergey)
* Typeracer / some kind of typing test
* battleships

    Hi-res stuff:

6. Figure out how hi-res graphics work:
* draw 0x00 thru 0xff tiling the screen, and see what it looks like.
    * diversion: figure out how to configure the compiler
      for a different load address (done!)
7. double-hi-res ??
8. Draw RC logo in hi res. On keypress toggle b/w white and green.
9. Tile the screen with the Pac-Man ghost outline, to prove out single color hi res
10. Display a 2-bit color still from a Pokémon game — might be harder and involve converting between image formats (could be a fun pairing project)
11. Pumpkin game-of-life (could be good for pairing)

Explore double hi res. Supposedly this gives us access to the full 16-color palette. (Q: does it change the number of distinct visible pixels, compared to normal hi res? Unclear so far, but sounds like yes? Except they mention a sliding(?) window which is odd…)

* stream images directly to the screen buffer over audio ??
    (think about this a bit; are there any cool ways to apply it?)

Physical floppies

Apple LOGO
* Russ Webb offered to give me a lesson :)

C docs
* flesh these out at some point
* include example programs from 2e/c ?
    * these are nice stepping stones / tutorials, in a way

    NOW:

[x] Easy 6502 tutorial
[x] Read this code: https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/simulator.html
[x] Adapt the above demo to run on the Apple II
    - The nice thing about this is it doesn't require any keyboard input
    - It does need randomness, but it's ok if the seed is the same every time.
[x] CHIP-8 interpreter

6502 > SWEET16 > n2t > CHIP-8

candidate order:
0. rust > chip8
1a. rust > n2t
1b. sweet16 > n2t
2. 6502 > sweet16
